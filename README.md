# Appearance Maker

Create custom appearances to customize your app's look with NSAppearance

# OS X El Capitan

In Yosemite, Appearance Maker didn't work because of changes in the private APIs used. I've done some testing on El Capitan and It looks like the APIs are fixed now, so I'll be releasing a new (totally rewritten, much better) version soon. Stay tuned!

# OS X 10.10

Appearance Maker does work on OS X 10.10, but some of the artwork exported doesn't match the new look.

## What's NSAppearance?

[Check the docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppKit/Reference/NSAppearance_Class/Reference/Reference.html). Even though Apple states you can create a custom appearance using Xcode, this is not currently available, so I've created this simple app that lets you make custom appearances.

## Download binary

If you just want to use It, [download the latest binary](https://raw.github.com/insidegui/AppearanceMaker/master/Binary/AppearanceMaker_latest.zip).

## How to use

Download, build & run, follow the instructions.

First you create an uicatalog file, then you export a "skeleton" (a directory structure containing the original images for each control).

After this is done you can edit the PSDs, then you export the .car file, put It in your bundle and use It :)

	self.window.appearance = [[NSAppearance alloc] initWithAppearanceNamed:@"Your-appearance-name" bundle:nil];
	
Appearance Maker itself uses a custom appearance:

## Automatic Compilation With Xcode Build Rule

If you want to compile your uicatalog file automatically when you build your project, follow the steps:

1. Use appearance maker to create an uicatalog file, export the assets and configure the fonts and colors as you want
2. Add the uicatalog file to your Xcode project, make sure It's listed under the "Copy Bundle Resources" section in your build phases
3. Go to "Build Rules" and click the "+" button to create a custom build rule
4. Leave "Source files with names matching:" selected and insert "*.uicatalog" in the text field
5. Leave "Custom Script:" selected and insert the following script:

```	
#!/bin/bash
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreThemeDefinition.framework/Versions/A/Resources/distill ${INPUT_FILE_PATH} ${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}/${INPUT_FILE_BASE}.car LogWarningsAndErrors
```
	
6. Under "Output files", click the "+" button and add this:

```
$(DERIVED_FILE_DIR)/$(INPUT_FILE_BASE).car
```

Now, whenever you build your Xcode project, the car file will be created and put in your bundle's resources directory ;)

## Can I use this and sell on the App Store?

Well, here's the thing: we are using private APIs to create the custom file, but NSAppearance itself is public, so the bottom line is yes, you can!
