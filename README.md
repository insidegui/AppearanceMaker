# OS X El Capitan

The current version only works on OS X El Capitan, Yosemite changed APIs and completely broke Appearance Maker, with El Capitan this project is usefull again.

This is a complete rewrite, there's a lot missing. I'll be pushing new stuff frequently.

## What's NSAppearance?

[Check the docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppKit/Reference/NSAppearance_Class/Reference/Reference.html). Even though Apple states you can create a custom appearance using Xcode, this is not currently available, so I've created this app that lets you make custom appearances.
